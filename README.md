### Background

 The sequel of an earlier project called Little Llama. It is a fun platform game built with JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas. The concept is the same as the original - jump on moving platforms and collect coins while avoiding bouncing pigs. Unlike the original, Little Llama 2 allows for weapon collection and use, more interaction between objects, a day and night background cycle, collisions that affect the display of the game screen, the option of two modes of play ("Classic/Normal" or "Flight"), the ability to pause and/or restart during gameplay, and the ability to save and display players' high scores.

### How To Play

The goal of the game is to collect as many coins as possible before running out of hearts. Colliding with a pig results in the loss of a heart. A new coin is randomly spawned at random coordinates on the game screen once a coin is collected.

#### -Normal/Classic Mode
Use the left and right keys to move and the up key to jump. Jump from platform to platform to reach each coin. Platforms also offer cover from pigs. Pigs bounce off the sides of the game screen as well as the platforms. The overall speed of the pigs will be constant throughout game play.

#### -Flight Mode
There are no platforms. The llama character glides up and down to collect the coins. Use the up, down, left, and right keys to glide in the respective directions. Pigs bounce off the sides of the game screen, off each other, and off any other object that collides with them (besides the llama character). The physics of the collisions between bouncing objects is elastic therefore objects are not always moving at the same speed.
